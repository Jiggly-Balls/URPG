I was making a game in pygame for my gfs birthday and a few days before her birthday
(which is on Aug 10th) I told her I'm making something special (for her birthday).

But she was devastated.

Because on August 1st (gf day) I made her the tower from tangled (her fav disney movie)
and she felt so bad for me cause I did so much for her (It only took me a few hours)
but she felt so bad after seeing what I made for her that she started to cry (idk if she
was crying out of happiness or pity).

And now here I am with a half finished game confused if I should finish it and show it
to her or not. I even insisted that I made it out of love but she felt heart broken 
when I told that to her.

Man.

Women are so complicated.

I don't even know what the fuck am I supposed to do for her birthday.
